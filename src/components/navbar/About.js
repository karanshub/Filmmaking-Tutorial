          <h1>What is Filmmaking</h1>
          <p>Filmmaking or film production is the process by which a motion picture is produced. Filmmakinginvolves a number of complex and discrete stages, beginning with an initial story, idea, or commission. Production then continues through screenwriting, casting, pre-production, shooting, sound recording, post-production, and screening the finished product before an audience, which may result in a film release and exhibition.
             The process is nonlinear, as the director typically shoots the script out of sequence, repeats shots as needed, and puts them together through editing later. Filmmaking occurs in a variety of economic, social, and political contexts around the world, and uses a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques to make theatrical films,
             episodic films for television and streaming platforms, music videos, and promotional and educational films.</p>
